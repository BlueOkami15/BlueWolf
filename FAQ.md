## Can you add Music?
A music bot is very expensive to run, so unless I am able to get at least $50 a month in donations it will not be possible for me to implement.
## Can you add [X] NSFW Command?
NSFW commands will not be added because I have no desire to add them.
## Will you ever add Memes to the bot?
No unless they're an inside joke between my group of friends, sorry.
## Are my Feature Requests being read?
I read all feature requests and respond to them.
##How can I invite Yuki-chan to my server?
You can use this [link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=161620224305528833&scope=bot&permissions=67365888)
##How Can I donate to the development?
Check in the [Useful Links](https://github.com/hsiw/WishBot/wiki/Useful-Links) Page, it has a one time donation as well as a monthly donation link.
##Where did Onee-chan go?
Onee-chan was just a name I came up with one day but over time it began to feel very generic and one note. I feel that Yuki-chan does a lot better job at conveying the image of the bot.
